# Applied Data Science with Python Worksheets
The notebooks I worked on for [Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) specialization.

The reason behind sharing my work is to showcase my problem-solving approach. This is purely for education purpose and not intended to be used to copy coursework by future students. I have used the most appropriate license and removed notebook versions to discourage direct mapping of questions with responses. **Kindly follow the Honor code if a student of this specialization**.
